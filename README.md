## 📊 Project Overview

Massive layoffs have affected the tech industry worldwide.  
Through this project, I used **SQL queries** to investigate:

- Companies with the **biggest single-day layoffs**.
- Companies with the **highest total layoffs** over time.
- **Trends by year and location**.
- A **rolling monthly total of layoffs** to understand peaks and shifts.
