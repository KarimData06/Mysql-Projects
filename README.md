## üìä Project Overview

Massive layoffs have affected the tech industry worldwide.  
Through this project, I used **SQL queries** to investigate:

- Which companies had the **largest percentage layoffs** (100% shutdowns).
- Companies with the **biggest single-day layoffs**.
- Companies with the **highest total layoffs** over time.
- **Trends by year and location**.
- A **rolling monthly total of layoffs** to understand peaks and shifts.

Starts in march 2020 with 9628 then it adds on the next month which is 26710 whitch equals 36338 then it adds on the next month and we get 62 adds on the next month 69769 it keeps going all the way down this just shows each month how many were laid off and this shows a month by month progression all the way down to the bottom 
In 2020 of 03 we had 9000 by the end of 2020 we had about an 80998 or so then at the beginning of 2021 all the way down to 2021 by the end of 2021 we only had 96821 So 2021 was a good year it looks like comparatively we‚Äôve been 91000 in the end of 2020 and in the end of 2021 we only have 96000 it‚Äôs only 15000 people that‚Äôs like nothing comparatively then in 2022 things start ramping up dramatically, it‚Äôs going from 97331 all the way up to 247153  it‚Äôs a lot of people losing their jobs all the way up to 383000 in the third year of 2023 , so from march of 2023 all the way back to march of 2020 lost their jobs and that like larger companies that have like series a funding IPOs ETC  but a lot of small businesses went out of business so we don‚Äôt have that information in this dataset 

NEXT is kind of look at the company the sum of totally loft

In 2020 the top five people who laid people off Uber, Booking, Groupon, swiggy, Airbnb  
In 2021 the largest layoff was Bytedance then Katerra, Zillow, Instacart, WhiteHat Jr
In 2022 we have Meta, Amazon, Cisco, Peloton, Carvana as wall as Phillips
And in 2023 we have Google, Microsoft, Ericsson, Amazon again, Salesforce, Dell
This is really interesting just looking at a year by year snapshot, these are the total laid off for each company and we could even go back and change this for like industry
